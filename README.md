# DateOnly
A very light weight Typescript library for Date without time part.
This library will allow to write much cleaner code as opposed to writing code using inbuilt class Date which also has time part. With this library, you to write code  which deals with dates only (like a code related to accounting and taxes).
One other very annoying thing with inbuilt Date class is that it treats month as index (0-11). In all real world usage, month range is 1-12. This library treats month from 1-12.
